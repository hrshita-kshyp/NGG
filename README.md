This Project is based on the Number guessing game This game is an interactive guessing game in Python. This is going to be a simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 to 10, and the user has to guess it in 5 attempts.
Based on the user’s guess computer will give various hints if the number is high or low. When the user guess matches the number computer will print the answer along with the number of attempts.

 ## The number guessing game, consists of 5 simple steps:
-  A function ‘guessing_game’ that takes no arguments

- The function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive)

- Ask the user to guess what number has been chosen

- Print accordingly for a guess: “too high”, “too low”, or “just right.”

- Allow the program only to exit after the user guessed correctly
 
 ### This program is not that different but I tried to code the random function 
 
  - In this project I learnt how to make test file,about unittest library,
